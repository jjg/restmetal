Initial entry.

Finally came-up with a name for this project last night.  Instead of trying to incorporate all of the current and proposed features of [JSFS](https://github.com/jjg/jsfs/) along with all of [RESTduino](https://github.com/jjg/restduino), and a single "firmware" to [span microcontrollers to mainframes](https://jasongullickson.com/posts/has-it-all-been-leading-to-this/), I'm going to focus on delivering an initial version targeting [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) devices.  This will change (although I'm not sure if that will be an expansion of this initial version, or perhaps different "flavors"), but I really want to make sure I can deliver a quality experience on MicroPython devices since the whole motivation behind pursuing this is to create a platform on which to develop privacy-respecting "smart" devices (another project in need of a name...).

I've been dabbling with this and have some initial code I need to move out of [halfbaked](https://gitlab.com/jgullickson/halfbaked) and into this repository.  Nothing that "works" quite yet, but this time I'm trying to keep track of incremental progress instead of focusing on only checking-in stuff that works.

I'm also using this as an opportunity to test-drive [codeberg](https://codeberg.org).  After my experience with Github and Gitlab I'm hesitant to invest too much time in working with anything other than raw, self-hosted git repositories, but this project could use some of the project management features codeberg provides, and if I have any intention of collaborating with others, it's going to be less of a hurdle for others.
